# SDLC

A sprint review and retrospective for a java project completed at SNHU.

## What I Learned

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?** <br>
One way to interpret user needs is to have a meeting with the users. Allow the users <br> to explain what they are looking for and take notes/listen. These wants can
be broken down <br>into user stories.<br><br> 
**2. How does creating “user stories” help with this?** <br>
User stories are used to break down the wants of the users into manageable pieces of work. <br> The development team can use these stories to begin working on the
project. <br><br>
**3. How do I approach developing programs?** <br>
We can approach developing programs with the software development lifecycle. Plan, define <br> requirements, design, develop, test, and deploy/maintain. Start with
the customer, obtain <br> information, plan, and accept change along the way. 

**4. What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?** <br>
I hope to incorporate the daily stand-ups and acceptance of change into my future <br> development work. Daily stand-ups help keep the team focused and change allows
the <br> customer to receive a product they can enjoy. <br>

**5. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?** <br>
A good team member is someone who communicates well, contributes to ideas, shares their <br> expertise, and is respectful to the team.
